  <div class="item14"><h3>Similarities</h3></div>
  <div class="item15">All positions require some level of team based work.  Either as a team member or supervisor/manager. 
The Front End Developer and Service Delivery Manager both deal with cloud services/applications either as a developer or manager of a team of developers.  These roles are both client facing requiring the skills to deal with customers of the business and interpret their needs. </div>
  <div class="item16"><h3>Differences</h3></div>
  <div class="item17">The Front End Developer role requires skills in web focused applications and languages.  This role includes the need for some knowledge of databases which isnâ€™t noted for either of the other roles. 
The Cyber Defense Operations Lead requires security focused skills not required by either other role as well as the ability plan or scope requirements.  This role also involves training of staff. 
The Service Delivery Manager includes more high level management tasks such as personnel and change management.   This role additionally is responsible for supervising the provision of web services and thus requires knowledge of appropriate web services.</div>
  <div class="item18"><h3>Conclusion</h3></div>
  <div class="item19">It appears from this sample that most IT roles require some level of team based work, either as a team member or supervisor/manager.  The ability to work in team would seem to be a critical skill.  This sample also indicates that a familiarity with cloud based services/applications will be an ongoing, if not, increasing component of IT careers. 
The difference in the roles in some ways serve to highlight the similarities.  Despite the technological difference, fundamentally, IT roles require a willingness and ability to work cooperatively with others.</div>
