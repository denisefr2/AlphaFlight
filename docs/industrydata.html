		<h2>Team comments</h2>
		<p>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</p>
		<h2>Denise:</h2>
		<p>The data hasn’t changed my opinion.  If anything, I feel supported and informed by the data which now gives me a clearer indication of which skills to focus on for the position generally, rather than specifically for the position advertised.</p>
		<h2>Zhaohe:</h2>
		<p>After looking at the data, this table gave me a clearer idea of how my ideal job fits in the industry. Prior of this data I did not see skill requirements in this perspective. It’s interesting to see the differences in skill requirements that my team has. For example, Denise as a front-end developer requires more IT related skills than other team members and less general skills. While Jennafer’s service delivery manager requires more general skills than other team members and less IT related skills. I did notice that the material we used was based on 2018, so I searched online for a more updated material, and I found out that Cybersecurity specialists is top 10 in demand for IT jobs. (https://www.thetechlearn.com/top-highest-paying-it-jobs-in-demand-for-future/). My opinion to become a Cybersecurity specialist remains solid, although all those skills required to learn does sound like hard work, but I am never as determined as I am now to grasp my goal. </p>
		<h2>Jennafer:</h2> 
		<p>Within my work environment my mentor is a service delivery manager who has provided me much of the skills and requirements for an SDM role. The Burning Glass data is a great way to see this information and cement my knowledge of the SDM requirements. Additionally, I found this information to be useful providing focus to my journey in becoming an SDM. Most notably, training in AWS and Azure are something that I personally should look to completing.</p>
