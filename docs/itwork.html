		<h2>Interview with IT professional [transcript]</h2>
		<p>Jenna: Hello and welcome to all of you to the very first podcast from Alpha Flight; my name is Jenna. I should start by addressing what the team Alpha Flight aims in delivering over the course of these podcasts. We aim in getting you all up to speed with all things IT and anything ongoing within the industry. So, it is very fitting that our first episode is aimed at our viewers who are keen to learn more about the industry and where you might find your place within it. So, without further adieu, I would like to welcome our first guest onto the show Wilson. ‘Crowd Applause’. Welcome Wilson, we are so thankful that you have taken some time out of your schedule to talk to our viewers about your experiences working in the IT industry. </p>
		<p>Wilson: Thanks for having me, Jen. </p>
		<p>Jenna: You are welcome. </p>
		<p>Jenna: Okay, so let’s start. What inspired you to work in the IT industry?</p>
		<p>Wilson: I will be honest, I kind of fell into IT. I originally trained as a schoolteacher, and then after finishing that, I found it was not really to my liking. I got offered a job in IT just working on the helpdesk, and then I just got into it through there and moved up. </p>
		<p>Jenna: Nice, and what was the life like in the helpdesk?</p>
		<p>Wilson: It was interesting, so it was just a standard helpdesk as you just usually deal with the user-facing issues sorting out the pointy all the personal facing side of it with a bit of exposure to the backend. It’s kind of to get your feet wet and to go from there. </p>
		<p>Jenna: Okay, and so what do you currently do now?</p>
		<p>Wilson: So, I am a level three systems administrator, so I look after a variety of environments based on our virtual infrastructure on-premises that holds a variety of windows and Linux servers that provide services to our users. </p>
		<p>Jenna: Okay, so that quite a big jump from ServiceDesk to level three, so what qualifications did you need to apply for a systems administrator job?</p>
		<p>Wilson: For this job, it was relatively broad in that you needed experience or qualifications in virtualisation technology, be it VMware or Hyper V. You needed experience in Wintel the Windows Intel system of products, specifically the Microsoft suite, windows 10, server 2016 and above, SCCM, and all the Microsoft systems center and other key management software so qualifications. I had was my MCSA (Microsoft certified systems administrator), I’ve also got a number of cloud technologies, and I’ve got a bachelor’s degree. </p>
		<p>Jenna: So quite a bit going on there, so what about experience?</p>
		<p>Wilson: So, experiences are arguably more necessary than qualifications, so I had by the time I got this job I had almost about six years closer to eight years sorry of experience in managing or administrating systems, and that includes a full range of basics of keeping a system alive and working to employing new technologies, adding new servers, and then deploying new products. </p>
		<p>Jenna: So, it was quite good that you have all that experience at level one, and you just progress slowly up to your system three. </p>
		<p>Wilson: Yeah, I would say that is generally the way it goes most of the time experience is far more valuable because whilst they can teach you the technology the vendor has, they don’t teach you how to work or integrate into the real world and what more important, the different ways they can affect things, so I find with IT experience generally trumps certification. </p>
		<p>Jenna: That’s an interesting point. Where there any other things since you’ve been doing this job that you’ve had to upskill yourself or additional training you have undertaken?</p>
		<p>Wilson: The shape of the world as it is cyber is where the new or the big push within all systems IT. I’ve done a number of other training courses looking at cyber security being offensive or defensive and looking at that area. And I would say that generally where I see my career path going in the future.</p>
		<p>Jenna: Already looking at the next thing, huh?</p>
		<p>Wilson: Yep</p>
		<p>Jenna: Could you just describer for our viewers kind of what’s the everyday life of a systems administrator looks like?</p>
		<p>Wilson: So, it kind of depends on what I’ve got going on for that week, but generally, I come in in the morning, and I would check ServiceDesk, which is a ticketing system, see if there is anything outstanding that has happened whilst I have left. Because we have got two main nodes that are in different time zones, and something has already happened or been identified that I keep working or I should start working on it straight away. So, I normally check my e-mails straight up to make sure nothing has happened whilst I have been away that I need to immediately divert my attention to. After that, I would generally have the tasks that I would want to get accomplished, whether that is implementing a new piece of software, looking at raising a change to fix something, adding additional porting, or adding automation to try and cut down my future ‘mandrolic’ work I’ll normally have stuff I need to do that day. And that is generally what I would spend the day doing, try and hit one or two of the key things I will have decided to do that day and working towards a large accomplishment for that week. </p>
		<p>Jenna: Okay, so you have touched on something there that most of the users coming into IT should probably learn about, and that’s change management. Can you describe the change management process?</p>
		<p>Wilson: Yeah. So, my workplace adheres to something called ITIL, and ITIL comes in a number of different versions, we are up to version 4, and it is essentially the process by which changes are made, or fixes are made to an environment. So, the idea is that nothing should happen in isolation, and everything should be documented, and there should be a controlled process for things to be stepped through. So generally, what the change management process is when a change has been identified as required or because there might be a problem with something, there might be an incident or somethings gone down, or there could just be an improvement that someone has identified. From there, a proposed solution will be drafted up by someone and then go through a change management board. That board will give their blessing or disapproval of it. From there, it is normally implemented in pre-production, which is a separate network where if outages happen, there it does not affect the production services. That is approved, it gets conducted, and it works it gets reviewed and once that’s done then another change gets raised, and the same process will happen in production./p>
		<p>Jenna: Okay, that is awesome. So, you have spoken a little bit before about some of the technologies that you use. What would you say is some of the main ones you use in that in that users or potential IT users will find themselves working on?</p>
		<p>Wilson: It kind of depends what shop you are in now because there is two, sorry what kind of approach your business take’s for IT. There is two main, I’d say, two broad types. We work on a mainly on-prem environment, so that means we host our own hardware infrastructure, so the main things I work on is the hypervisors, and for us, that’s VMware. For our environment, the majority are Windows, so mainly Windows Server 2016 and 2019 servers that sit on there, and then we have a few Linux servers here and there. The other side of the hat is for one of our environments, we are heavily cloud-focused, so rather than maintain the infrastructure, we work on our instances that are hosted on cloud services so based on someone else’s computer, so we use AWS, Azure, and cloud for that. </p>
		<p>Jenna: Okay, so you are a bit of a jack of all trades?</p>
		<p>Wilson: Master of none</p>
		<p>Jenna: You haven not really spoken about your client much, but how would you say you discuss all your plans of IT solutions with them to make sure you are giving them exactly what they want? How does that relationship work?</p>
		<p>Wilson: There is kind of two sides to this, so a standard change management process there always a member or a client is always on the board they get to look over the proposed solutions and changes and give their seal of approval to it to make sure they are happy. For larger developmental changes during the scoping of the work so the client might come to us and say we want X, Y and Z because of this. We will scope out their user requirements and find out exactly what they need the system to do and what they like us to do, and the right outputs of it. From there, we will develop a plan that goes into forming a user acceptance testing, so basically a list of things the system the change should be able to do, and we go build it to speck, and once we know it matches all the requirements we will take it back to the user, and with them, we will perform some of the user’s acceptance testing.</p>
		<p>Jenna: So that is kind of your client-side so what about within your team? What’s the general makeup of you said you’re in a service delivery team? </p>
		<p>Wilson: Yeah, so we have got kind of two main teams; there is a service delivery manager on either side of either team. They are basically the head honcho that is there to liaise or provide that first interface with the client and control our tasks and our work efforts and then keep us on track and make sure we are hitting the required what they see our requirements to meet SLAs (service level agreements), so they are on top. So then on the other user-facing side, we have got a level one/two member. She is the interface with the client, so any issues that come in the door, she will take them and triage them if she’s able to, she will fix them and if not she will raise problems or changes and wait for one of us to have a look at it. Then also, there is another with the team itself there is two other sorry with myself there is two other administrators, and they do the same thing I do. They have generally got a system each, and they will look at that, maintain that and keep it kicking along. And then at the enterprises level sorry the organisational level, we have a cyber security expert who is there to sit across everything and make sure that all our systems align with best practices, keep everything secure and provide recommendations for anything new that we create. There is also a development team, and their job is essentially projects. So, they will sit down and if it is kind of outside what we or would look at normally, they will sit down and look at services and designing new things as required and do that continual improvement of the whole system. </p>
		<p>Jenna: Okay, so it’s quite a well-rounded organisation you’ve got there with lots of experts doing their own little pigeonholed jobs, which is good. </p>
		<p>Wilson: In theory.</p>
		<p>Jenna: In theory yes, so you find that that works well, and when things go well it goes well, but what are some of the aspects of your job that you find challenging?</p>
		<p>Wilson: I would say for us communication between teams because we are ono two different sides of the country a lot can get lost in translation between it. There has been a number of approaches we have taken to try and mitigate that, but communication is always a problem that can arise when you are in the same location. As with all teams, there is always going to be personality conflicts, luckily we do not have too many within our team, but that always poses issues. Luckily for us, the client is not too much of an issue; I would say they are generally quite supportive and understanding and quite a pleasure to work for. I would say for us generally the main problems are just your normal workplace social ones. Then just the unforeseen technology ones, when something breaks all of a sudden and you don’t know why and you have got to rush to find the root cause of it, that is always an interesting.</p>
		<p>Jenna: One really good way to learn, though, right?</p>
		<p>Wilson: Yes.</p>
		<p>Jenna: I appreciate your time you have spent with us, but if I could ask one more question, what would be the advice you would give to someone to start a career within IT? </p>
		<p>Wilson: Just find a job that generally relates to it. You are normally going to have to start at the bottom; you won’t normally be able to jump straight into being the top dog. So, start at the bottom and get experience and then just try and assimilate everything, learn everything when things need to be done, just put your hand up and lean in to try and do things. Because for me, the only way I learnt is by doing. I just tried to do everything, and after a while, I became good at it. So just lean in, look at new technologies and get your head around it and be able to Google, because if you aren’t able to Google then you may as well not be in IT because it holds all the answers. </p>
		<p>Jenna: That is some good advice there. Well, Wilson, I would like to thank you again for coming on to our show or podcast and being the first person, it has been a pleasure to interview you, and I thank you for the time. </p>
		<p>Wilson: Thanks for having me, Jen. </p>
		<p>Jenna: Bye.</p>
