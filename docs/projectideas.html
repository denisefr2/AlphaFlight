		<h2>Browser based Role Playing Game - Cat-a-wall</h2>
		<h3><em>Overview</em></h3>
		<p>The project is a browser based, single player, role playing game. The game will be story focused, include both text, audio and puzzle interactions. There will be branching story lines dependent on user choice enhancing re-play ability. (Freed, 2014, Branching Conversation Systems and the Working Writer, Blog)</p>
		<p>Browser based games aren’t unusual, however, they are often created with the aim of ‘time gating’ or selling access to content and items, either immediately or after a short time of play. The predatory leanings of developers can often lead to issues with users spending more money then they are able to, or being blocked from content when unwilling to spend money (Wirtz, 2021, Pay to Win Games are Taking Over: How Much Are You Willing to Pay?, Game Designing)(EnyGames, 2021, Pay to Win MMORPG )(Kelly, 2017, Kids who wasted thousands of dollars on gaming, Grunge).</p>
		<h3><em>Funding</em></h3>
		<p>The aim of this project would be to create a game open to anyone to play, with no cost required during the life of the story. Progression won’t be blocked by a required purchase.</p>
		<p>With this goal in mind, it will be necessary to fund both the development, continued maintenance and update cycle using means other than cash shop (Slant, undated, What are the best ways to fund development of an independent game?)(DellaFave, 2014, How to fund your indie game, Game Development).</p>
		<p>With this mind, the following have been identified as the most commonly accessed options:</p>

		<h3><em>Development Plan</em></h3>

		<h3><em>Technologies</em></h3>
		<p>There a several competing technologies that may be used in the development of a browser based game.  The options vary dependant on the intended complexity of the end results.</p>
		<p>It would be possible to create a functional games with simple graphics.  These types of games are commonly created using (for example) HMTL5, javascript and an open source graphics engine (Kent, 2020, A list of awesome games made with HTML5 and JavaScript, Ma-no).</p>
		<p>However, it is preferable that the released game has the appearance of a more sophisticated product with the functionality of a non-browser game.  It is possible to create a game that looks similar to those created using Javascript with an open source graphics engine, however, as Unity and Unreal both allow the use of more sophisticated graphics with little to no appreciable difference to the user experience, it seems logical to use an engine that will allow at the very least, the introduction of more sophisticated world graphics (Itch.io, 2022, Top HTML5 Games tagged Unreal Engine(100 results))( Itch.io, 2022, Top HTML5 Games made with Unity (58,117 results)</p>
		<p>The choice of engine may be based on platforms where the game is to be released, or, level of skill the developer currently has as well as pricing/licensing structure and platform integrations.</p>
		<p>The following is a comparison of the licensing, pricing and other related factors in the two major engines:</p>

		<h3><em>Story outline</em></h3>
		<p>As mentioned, the game will be story focused, with all activities the player takes part in contributing to world building. Each non player character will play a part in immersing the player in the the game world. There will be multiple branches to the story, where each decision the player takes, every quest giver missed, changes both the journey and the conclusion. Replayability is key in the longevity of any role playing game and it is the prime consideration of this game’s design.</p>
		<p><em>High fantasy 2.5D single player role playing game.</em></p>
		<p><em>World name - Aran</em></p>
		<p><em>City hubs:  (Two on initial release)</em></p>
		<p><em>Principal antagonist: <strong>Red Dragon Wyrmvyr</strong></em></p>
		<p><u>Stage 1 – Character creation</u></p>
		<p>The user will be able to select from a range of races, genders with as much scope to customise the appearance of their characters allowed by the engine/platform.</p>
		<p>Each race will have base statistics that will affect their compatibility with particular classes. The concept is similar to Dungeons & Dragons but is not intended to be as prescriptive. (See The Gamer). The range of races and classes will be limited at launch but more may be added over time dependent on take up.</p>
		<p>All first time users will go to character creation after loading.</p>
		<p><u>Step 2 – Tutorial</u></p>
		<p>User character spawns into a small area with one non player character (npc).  This npc (a cat) will explain the game mechanics and give a introduction to story.  The cat acts as exposition here and during the game proper.</p>

		<p><u>Step 3 – Game play</u></p>
		<p>On completion of the tutorial the user will spawn into their selected starting City.  Race, class and city chosen will all affect user statistics and quest starting point.</p>

		<p>The story will branch dependent on user choice and dialog options taken with non-player characters.</p>
		<p><em>Exploration</em></p>
		<p>As the game will be browser based, it is intended that any combat will be primitive in nature and not depicted in any great detail. The main focus of the game is intended to be story and most conflicts will arise from that. The game will release with two maps, with more to be added in stages. This won’t be an open world and travel will be depicted using a graphic rather than real time via characters walking between destinations.</p>
		<p>It is intended that each map will hold 10 minor hubs with one major hub per map. The major hub will hold the inns (or resting place), which serves as the base for all player interactions with merchants and rest areas.</p>
		<p>The minor hubs will be village/small town areas with quest givers, crafting stations and short term rest areas.</p>
		<p><em>Combat</em></p>
		<p>Combat will be rudimentary in nature as the focus is intended to be on story telling/crafting/solving problems through dialogue.</p>
		<p><em>Crafting</em></p>
		<p>A basic but complete crafting mechanic will be available. It will not be compulsory but will however work as an adjunct for users to create armour, weapons and other items that may be required during the game.</p>
		<p>The crafting mechanics will include gathering resources, creating components and finally creating the final item. Local tradespeople in the minor hubs will offer recipes, tools and other items for sale for in game currency.</p>
		<p><em>Currency</em></p>
		<p>In game currency will be earned from quest givers and other non playable characters by completing quests, assisting with tasks, such as harvesting, animal husbandry and manual labour. Currency may also be earned while traveling between hubs from non player characters with puzzles and other problems the player might want to solve. It is intended that there will be sufficient ways to earn currency whether the user takes part in a facets of the game or not.</p>
		<p><strong><em>Future release goals:</strong></em></p>
		<ol>
		<li>Over world/under world hubs and payable areas</li>
		<li>Additional races</li>
		<li>More crafting classes</li>
		<li>More combat classes</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong><em>Conclusion</strong></em></p>
		<p>There will be an initial learning curve while learning the Engine and how to create the HTML5 code with that. Unreal is a widely used engine and there are numerous resources available for learning, including those available from Epic Games, the create and owner of the engine. (see Unreal Engine).</p>
		<p>Along with the engine, tools are available to assist in the creation and mapping of branching story writing (See Yo Scenario).</p>
		<p>It should be reasonable to expect that with an initial time investment that the skills required to start the project can be gained. Once the project has started, the work itself will aid in the growth of further skills.</p>
		<p>If the project is successfully launched and uptake by users is good, we can perhaps hope that we can demonstrate that good, free games can be developed without the need to prey on sometimes vulnerable users.</p>
