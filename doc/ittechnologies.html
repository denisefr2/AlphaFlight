		<h3><u>Cloud Services:</u></h3>
		<p>This report seeks to explore the basic concepts of cloud computing and its benefits. Furthermore, it seeks to explore the impact of cloud computing within the IT community. Finally, this report will end on a personal note as I explore the impacts cloud computing has on my life.</p>
		<p>In its simplest form, cloud computing uses third-party provided hardware and software over the internet, nullifying the requirement for on-premises solutions. The cloud computing industry is rapidly expanding into a multi-billion-dollar economy and continues to grow (Saleem 2020). The rapid expansion of cloud services is driving the evolution of IT solutions enterprises are now adopting. </p>
		<p>The primary offering from cloud service providers is deploying systems in a scalable way that suits a customer's unique requirement. Cloud computing is offered in three different models: public, private, or hybrid (Citrix 2021). </p>
		<p>Public cloud services allow organisations to purchase access to computing resources from a cloud service provider allowing user access via the internet (VMware 2022). Public cloud computing is offered in three distinct categories. These are as software as a service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS). Below is a brief description of each category:  </p>
		<ul>
		<li>SaaS includes the delivery of applications hosted by a cloud service provider accessible by the user over the internet (Chai 2021). SaaS removes the need for users to physically install, manage, and licence each end device. Examples include Dropbox, Salesforce and Slack (Cloudflare 2022). </li>
		<li>IaaS comprises the physical resources, including compute (virtual machines), networking devices (routers, switches) and storage (data centres), which are provided in an on-demand allocation to organisations (IBM Education 2019). All upkeep of the physical equipment is done by the service providers and managed under a service-level agreement (SLA). IaaS includes Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine and Microsoft Azure (Watts & Raza 2019). </li>
		<li>PaaS is when a third party provides hardware and software that perform a function outlined by an end-user (Red Hat, 2019). PaaS typically allows developers to run their applications without maintaining the infrastructure. Examples of a PaaS include SAP Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Google App Engine (Shim 2021)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Below is a picture from Red Hat (2019) that depicts a breakdown of the management requirements per cloud category:</p>
		<!--<img src="ittechnologypicture1.png" alt="cloud category"> -->
		<p>Private clouds still incorporate some of the aspects of the cloud categorises. However, all hardware and software are proprietary to a company in a single-tenant environment (IBM Cloud Education 2020). Private cloud allows organisations to utilise the benefits of cloud services but maintain security over the infrastructure and data. Typically, this environment is used within medical and financial institutions or others dealing with sensitive information. Services generally are deployed by technology such as virtualisation, management software and automation (IBM Cloud Education 2020). </p>
		<p>The last cloud model is a hybrid cloud; this integrates public and private cloud environments and can include on-premises hardware (Cloudfare 2022). A hybrid model allows organisations to pivot services off each other to operate most efficiently to the business. </p>
		<p>The advantages of adopting a cloud-based model in enterprise solutions are as follow: </p>
		<ul>
		<li>Affordability: As most cloud service vendors offer on-demand solutions, businesses only purchase what they require minimising wastage of expenditure on IT. </li>
		<li>Scalability: Allows organisations to rapidly expand or decrease their systems with minimal overhead to IT personnel (Business Queensland 2017). </li>
		<li>Freedom of movement: Cloud services provide a means by which isolated teams can connect and work in their organisational environment without the need of being physically at work (Peterson 2021).  </li>
		<li>Back-up and restore points: Organisational data can be stored securely with cloud service providers (Java T Point 2021). </li>
		<li>Disaster Recovery: Due to the diverse nature of cloud computing, services can efficiently be run in line with each other to automatically failover if one cluster or part breaks (Global Dots 2018). </li>
		</ul>
		<p>As the cloud service industry continues to change the IT landscape and develop the technology further, businesses will be more likely to migrate their services to the cloud. The rapid migration of services to the cloud will result in the market for physical hardware declining and, in turn, make it harder to source the right equipment for your on-premises solutions, with most vendors preferring to utilise cloud solutions (Linthicum 2013). Reducing quality on-premises solutions could be challenging for strictly regulated organisations, for example, those that hold sensitive data. </p>
		<p>As organisations continue migrate to cloud services, a greater emphasis will be placed on internet service providers (ISP) to keep up with demand. Businesses, as such, can become vulnerable to the outages of their ISP, of which they have no control (Larkin 2019).    </p>
		<p>New technology must be met with further training and educational standards. Adapting with technology is universities offer more cloud-based courses. In addition, those already trained and in the industry will be required to upskill to stay relevant (Applause IT Recruitment 2022). The introduction of quantum computing into cloud services through providers Google, Amazon, and Microsoft has already changed the cloud services landscape (Moutafis 2021). However, IT professionals have a relatively giant leap in understanding and advancing technology (Enterprise Engineering Solutions 2022).</p>
		<p>The transition of enterprise solutions to cloud-based services creates the next challenge for me. Although we rely heavily on fixed on-premises solutions in my current work-life, we are starting to pivot some services towards the cloud. New technology comes with new lessons to be learnt, and as such, as an IT professional, it behoves me to continue to grow with the current trends. These lessons learnt can then be introduced back into my workplace. This ensures that any solutions we offer our clients are to a high standard and in line with the IT industry. </p>
		<p>Furthermore, cloud services have changed how I navigate technology within my own home. Services such as Netflix, OneDrive, internet banking are becoming an integral part of life. However, as an end-user, I do have concerns about the security of my data. For example, hosting a lifetime of photographs and videos in the cloud is a cheap and easy way to store data; however, it is now a lifetime of images and videos that I am handing over to someone else. Conversely, setting up and maintaining a NAS counters the security concerns but increases the administrative overhead. In the future, end-users will continue to debate the merits of practicality and security prioritising according to their beliefs. </p>

		Cybersecurity
		--------->
		<br \>
		<h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
		<p>In Cybersecurity, there are no such technologies at this point to give you foolproof protection against cyber adversaries.[1] Even the most robust hardware and software can be susceptible to attacks from malicious insiders such as staff members, former staff members, contractors or business associates who have legitimate access to your systems and data.[2] Regardless of malicious insiders, there still pose a risk where well-intended employees may accidentally jeopardize the security of a business or spill data.</p>
		<p>Therefore in the Cybersecurity sector, one should not rely on a single “state of the art technology” as a piece of technology that defends against all attacks, but a mixture of protocols, guidelines and technical measures with the assistance of advanced technologies.[3]</p>
		<p>Cyber attacks are becoming more complicated, both the volume and complexity of threats are growing exponentially.[4] When it comes down to identifying Cybersecurity vulnerabilities, analyzing data and detecting Cybersecurity threats, the vast amount of information can be difficult for humans to process.[5] It is why in my view if I were to designate a state of the art technology to the Cybersecurity field, I would choose the incorporation of machine learning. I have to regress to state that machine learning is a subset of the broader category of AI and there are fundamental differences between these two disciplines. People often mix them up and see these terms as if referred to the same processes.[6]</p>
		<p>Machine learning models in Cybersecurity relies on feeding the algorithm extensive amounts of historical and simulated Cyber incidents. The model will then be able to determine what it is that these incidents have in common, and therefore able to identify an incident.[7] Machine learning models are more efficient than humans in detecting anomalies and there are some commonly used cases such as:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><b>False-positive reduction</b>, which are alerts that incorrectly indicates the presence of a threat when the threat is not present. Machine learning models can be trained to identify certain patterns that indicate a false positive.[8]</li>
		<li><b>Malware detection</b>, most of the latest anti-virus software is already integrated with machine learning that uses vast samples of data to predict and recognize signs of malware. Traditional anti-virus uses signatures (Cross-referencing from a huge database of known malware) but signatures requires frequent updates and are ineffective against threats such as a file-less malware that doesn’t write anything to the disk.[9]</li>
		<li><b>Identifying threats</b>, not only can a machine learning model recognize patterns and detect anomalies, but model algorithms are also capable of predicting and identifying new types of threats.[10]</li>
		<li><b>Preventing Spam in E-mails and SMS</b>, scams and phishing in the form of E-mail and SMS are prevalent in our everyday lives. Machine learning models check for E-mails and SMS match the patterns with ordinary mails to detect anomalies. The detection speed is faster than traditional software and accuracy increases over time.[11]</li>
		<li><b>Preventing DDoS attacks</b>, Distributed Denial of service are Cyberattacks that uses a network of com-promised systems(botnet) and floods a website with connection requests to deny legitimate user access to the website and can cause a website to slow down drastically or crash entirely. Machine learning models can be used to prevent DDoS attacks by analyzing data then distinguishing compromised systems that are used as bots, much more effectively than humans can.[12]</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Cybersecurity’s machine learning today is not like machine learning of the past, as specialists conduct more simulations and feed machine learning models with more data, it is still focused primarily on the technical aspects.[13] Cyberspace is a socio-technical realm, not only do we have to be vigilant of technical aspects, but it also has to be combined with behavioural insights. I would say in the following few years, to improve Cybersecurity, we need to understand how the attackers think to better model preventive measures and simulations. That means in addition to Cybersecurity specialists, psychologists and criminologists should also be added into the Cybersecurity domain.[14]</p>
		<p>Another technological development that enhances user online security and data integrity is a Blockchain-based data architecture. Cloud storage based on Blockchain can provide a decentralized and tamper-proof record.[15] Decentralized VPNs provides a secure, safe and reliable network connection to users and users can be confident that their data will not get leaked or hacked.</p>
		<p>Most Cyberattacks are financially motivated[16], after compromising the data of victims, there needs to be a way to cash out those data, therein lies the market. Without a market, the number of Cyberattacks would reduce significantly. Consequently, E-commerce websites, payment gateways, banks and other financial sectors are the main targets from Cyberattacks and are mostly affected by the development of machine learning in Cybersecurity. These businesses are constantly defending themselves against identity theft, account takeovers and payment fraud. The traditional method for a business to block fraudulent transactions was to merely rely on rules, but rules alone can cause issues such as a high number of false positives, inefficiency and hard to keep up with more sophisticated methods that criminals use. By using machine learning models, these businesses are able to detect threats faster and more accurately, reduce costs and losses.[17]</p>
		<p>As technology in Cybersecurity progress, it is becoming harder for amateur attackers to succeed. At one point, anyone could buy a credit card[18] for $50 and spend hundreds or thousands with it on online shopping, now with the advent of machine learning fraud detection models, this direct method will not work as the model will detect anomalies, judging by previous spending habits, IP address, model of web browser or phone browser, risk assessment based on the purchased product resalable value and the ease of reselling.[19] However, advances in technology can be a double-edged sword. There has been a growing number of malicious machine learning uses. As seen in the Ticketmaster incident[20] in 2010, machine learning tools to defeat Captchas are readily available. Machine learning can also be used to speed up brute force attacks as well as automate exploit generation and mimicking normal patterns of behaviour to avoid detection.[21]</p>
		<p>By the looks of current statistics[22], there is a shortage of Cybersecurity specialists and the shortage will continue to grow in the upcoming years. The advent of machine learning in Cybersecurity will not cause redundancy of jobs but will replace traditional technologies that can be done more efficiently with machine learning models.</p>
		<p>For an ordinary user like myself, my files would be safer if stored in a leading cloud companies server instead of just leaving them in my desktop folder.[23]These companies such as Google Cloud allocate a significant amount of resources to both their physical and Cyber security and are most likely using state of the art technology.</p>
		<p>When businesses get hacked and incur a loss, they generally mark up the price of their product to make up for the loss and we as consumers have to pay for it, so increased Cybersecurity for business does bring collective good to me. Since most amateur attackers are out of business and it is in the best interest of skilled Cyber adversaries to maximize their profit by targeting large corporations instead of individuals. I as an individual should feel relatively safer provided that I follow reasonable safety precautions.</p>
		<p>As anti-virus software becomes more powerful[24], the risk of our devices getting compromised lowers and we are all less likely to become part of a botnet. My friends and I now experience a cleaner and safer online environment.</p>

		Natural Language processing and chatterbots
		--------->
		<br \>
		<h2>Natural Language processing and chatterbots</h2>
		<p><u>What does it do?</u></p>
		<p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows humans to communicate with machines without the need for a programming language.  NLP can interact with users via written or verbal input (Tatum, undated, What is a chatterbot, Easy Tech Junkie)</p>
		<p>NLP doesn’t just interpret speech or writing, it understands how language works .  It uses preprogramed or acquired knowledge to “decode meaning and intent from factors such as sentence structure, context, idioms” (Natural language processing, 2020, Chatbot, Landbot).</p>
		<p>The concept of NLP has its roots in the idea of ‘language as a science’ created by Ferdinand de Saussure in Switzerland in the early 20th century (Foote, 2019, A brief history of natural language processing, Dataversity).</p>
		<p>Alan Turing’s 1950 paper on the “Turing Test” (for a full explanation of the Turing test, see Oppy, Graham and David Dowe, "The Turing Test", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2021 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)) followed by publication by Hodgkin and Huxley of their experiments around “determining the laws that govern the movement of ions in a nerve cell during an action potential…” (Biomedical Directed Reading, 2004, ENGE 093, Swarthmore College) proved the inspiration for the idea of Artificial Intelligence, NLP and the creation of computers (Foote, 2019).</p>
		<p><u>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</u></p>
		<p><em>Self Supervised Learning</em></p>
		<p>Self supervised learning is a method of machine learning that trains itself by using existing data to predict and complete missing components (Hajjar, 2021 In-Depth Guide to Self-Supervised Learning: Benefits & Uses).</p>
		<p><em>Combinatory Categorical Grammar</em></p>
		<p>According to Steedman (2000,CCG) Combinatory Categorical Grammar is a “strongly lexicalised grammar formalisation”.</p>
		<p>Prange, Schneider & Srikumar in their paper, Super tagging the Long Tail with Tree-Structured Decoding of Complex Categories, deal with rare-tags and methods of recovering the data usually lost.</p>
		<p><u>What can be done now?</u></p>
		<p><em>Project Debater</em></p>
		<p>Project Debater is an IBM research project that has successfully developed an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can debate humans on complex topics (Slonim, N., Bilu, Y., Alzate, C. et al. 2021, An autonomous debating system)</p>
		<p><em>Intelligent Virtual Assistants/Intelligent Personal Assistants</em></p>
		<p>Intelligent Virtual Assistants (IVA) use NLP to interpret voice commands from users.  Some IVA are able to respond with their own synthesized voice both to expected and unexpected comments or questions.  IVA’s may open/close/use applications on the home device (Virtual Assistant, Wikipedia).</p>
		<p><em>Gaming</em></p>
		<p>In their paper Bringing Roguelikes to Visually-Impaired Players by Using NLP, Vilares et al, discuss the use of NLP to enable visually impaired players to access the usually graphics heavy genre of roguelikes (for an explanation of Roguelikes see Lee, 2021, What’s a Roguelike vs. Rogue lite? Is the Difference Really That Important?).</p>
		<p>Duran & Lewandowski’s paper Demonstration of a Serious Game for Spoken Language Experiments – GDX, discusses using the Gamified Discrimination Experiments engine (GDX), “…as a research tool with an application focusing on attention to fine phonetic detail in natural speech perception…. Applications of this novel game-based framework are multifarious within studies on all aspects of spoken language perception…”.</p>
		<p><u>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</u></p>
		<ul>
		<li>Sentiment analysis on social media</li>
		<li>Multilingual NLP</li>
		<li>Chatbots and Customer Assistants taken to next-level</li>
		<li>Automation in NLP</li>
		<li>Combining Supervised & Unsupervised Methods</li>
		<li>Deep Learning in NLP</li>
		<li>Market Intelligence Monitoring (See Goled, 2021 for a full description of each topic.)</li>
		<li>emotion analytics (See Somers, 2019, Emotion AI, explained.)</li>
		</ul>
		<p><u>What technological or other developments make this possible?</u></p>
		<p>Deep learning is key to advances in NLP:</p>
		<p class="tab">“Understanding spoken words…was actually a really hard problem up until 2010 when deep learning changed it…we don’t call it AI anymore, it’s just Siri, just a speech recognition software.” (Socher, 2021, quoted in Chatterbots 6)</p>
		<p>COVID-19 and its attendant affects seem to have caused an acceleration in advancement:</p>
		<p class="tab">“80 percent of companies are already using automation software or plan to use this technology in the next 12 months, and for more than one-in-three organizations, the pandemic influenced their decision to use automation to bolster the productivity of employees, while others found new applications of this technology to make themselves more resilient, such as helping to automate the resolution of IT incidents.” (Global Data from IBM Points to AI Growth…, 2021, IBM)</p>
		<p><b>What is the likely impact?</b></p>
		<p><u>What is the potential impact of this development?</u></p>
		<p>IBM’s Global Adoption Index indicate that approximately one third of business are currently using Artificial Intelligence (AI).  Forty three percent further state that rollout of AI has accelerated due to COVID-19 (IBM, 2021).</p>
		<p>This seems to have both negative and positive impacts.  Organisations in areas that allow both the cost and use of NLP/AI will continue to advance and profit.  However, “…some global businesses are still facing a multitude of challenges when it comes to adopting AI. Persistent barriers across markets and industries highlight the need for continued focus on addressing skills and solutions gaps” (IBM, 2021).</p>
		<p><u>What is likely to change?</u></p>
		<p>It seems from the above, that how people interact with technology, either knowingly or otherwise, will change fundamentally.  Voice activation instead of physical interaction, data processed intelligently by AI on social media, self learning algorithms that increase their effectiveness and intelligence.</p>
		<p>The emotions of the users will be part of the way NLP carries out its functions.  Whether this is for good or ill will depend on the use the technology is put to (Stark & Hoey, 2021, The Ethics of Emotion in Artificial Intelligence Systems).</p>
		<p><u>Which people will be most affected and how?</u></p>
		<p>Extrapolating from the above, it seems logical to assume that the following may be negatively impacted by advancements in NLP:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>organisations unable to fund the necessary technology</li>
		<li>organisations with business models unsuited to the use of NLP interfaces</li>
		<li>employees of said organisations</li>
		<li>people unwilling or unable to adopt new modes of interacting with technology</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There will, of course, be positive impacts around NLP advancements.  Younger generations born into a world with this technology, or simply those eager to embrace the changes.</p>
		<p><u>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</u></p>
		<p>In a report dated 2017, Mckinsey & Co posit that:</p>
		<p class="tab">“Automation and AI will lift productivity and economic growth, but millions of people worldwide may need to switch occupations or upgrade skills.” (Mckinsey, 2017)</p>
		<p>This report is of course broader than discussing the potential affects of NLP on employment, however, we might use this as a guide to assist with considering the implications of NLP adoption more broadly.</p>
		<p>To quote the report’s conclusions:</p>
		<p class="tab">“…It is important to note, however, that even when some tasks are automated, employment in those occupations may not decline but rather workers may perform new tasks.
		Automation will have a lesser effect on jobs that involve managing people, applying expertise, and social interactions, where machines are unable to match human performance for now.
		Jobs in unpredictable environments - occupations such as gardeners, plumbers, or providers of child- and eldercare - will also generally see less automation by 2030, because they are technically difficult to automate and often command relatively lower wages, which makes automation a less attractive business proposition.” (Mckinsey, 2017)
		</p>
		<p><b>How will this affect you?</b></p>
		<p><u>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</u></p>
		<p>As an IT adjacent professional primarily involved with the use and automation of business software, these advances have the potential to affect my working life significantly.</p>
		<p>Professionally, NLP has the potential to render the part of my occupation dealing with document automation redundant.  It seems to me that document automation has significant potential for automation via NLP rather than physical input.  It will be necessary to reskill to ensure continued employment.</p>
		<p>Personally, interactions with banking applications, smart devices, chatbots, perhaps more, will change significantly requiring the need to keep pace with advancements.</p>
		<p><u>What will be different for you?</u></p>
		<p>As I may be required to either seek alternative employment, or, undertake extensive retraining advances in NLP in my particular industry will affect my professional life significantly.</p>
		<p>The professional services sector is slow to embrace change, thus, once NLP and its attendant technologies and changes start to be adopted I expect to see more than my own profession changed.  My colleagues in law may find themselves needing to have more technical skills than previously to keep up with their industry.</p>
		<p><u>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</u></p>
		<p>I am currently required to interface with technology for some older members of my family.  If NLP continues to advance in their lifetime, I will be required to deal with any changes on their behalf in addition to their current needs.</p>
		<p>The younger family members, the children of my siblings, will adapt more quickly.  Its possible that their future choice of profession will be affected by advancements before they’re affected in any personal way.</p>
		<p>Overall, I feel there will be both positive and negative effects dependant on the willingness and/or ability of the individual to adapt and embrace the changes.</p>

		Blockchain and cryptocurrencies
		------------->
		<br \>
		<h2>Blockchain and cryptocurrencies</h2>
		<p>The foundation of cryptocurrency is based on a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.[1] This type of digital currency is used as a medium of exchange and allows payment sent online from one party to another without going through financial institutions. The decentralized payment network is powered by its users and has no central authority or middlemen.[2] Blockchain technology is based on this innovative type of decentralized payment system. Blockchain was first invented by an individual (or a group of people) under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and it served as the cryptocurrency Bitcoin’s public ledger.[3] Cryptocurrency also serves as a trustless payment system, where all payments are based on cryptographic proof and two willing parties can make a transaction with each other without the need of a trusted third party. </p>
		<p>Blockchain consists of a series of growing records or public ledgers called blocks. Blocks have certain storage capacities and contain a cryptographic hash (signature), timestamp and transaction data of the previous block.[4] Once the block reaches its storage capacity it will be closed and linked to the previously filled block, forming a chain, and with each additional block reinforcing the ones before it. Therefore, blockchains are practically impossible to cheat because for one to alter data on the blockchain, all subsequent blocks will have to be modified.[5] This means the attacker would have to create an alternative fake blockchain faster than the real blockchain, even if this is achievable, the attacker can’t create money out of thin air or steal other users’ money as nodes will not accept an invalid transaction as payment, an attacker can only try to change one of its transactions to take back the money he had recently spent.[6]</p>
		<p>Users can increase security by downloading the whole copy of the blockchain and validating blocks, thus the more individual users there are to validate, the more secure and immutable the blockchain is.[7] When you download the whole copy of the blockchain to your device, your device acts as a server in the decentralized network and becomes a full node. Full nodes are also the ones that get to vote on proposals. Developers propose changes or upgrade, then 51% of the full nodes must agree or else it gets skipped.[8]</p>
		<p>Many users download lightweight nodes and are known as SPV nodes or simple payment nodes (light wallet). This type of node doesn’t store a copy of the blockchain but instead communicates with full nodes and relies on full nodes to provide the information. Lightweight nodes only ask full nodes for the current status of the latest block and broadcast the transaction for processing. The benefit of being lightweight is that it doesn’t require as many resources but instead sacrifices security for convenience.[9]</p>
		<p>No one owns blockchain much like no one owns the internet, blockchain is controlled by users around the world. [10] Even though developers try to help improve the software, they can’t change a blockchain protocol unless most of the nodes agree to do so. </p>
		<p>Since blockchain has no central authority, decisions are made by using the consensus mechanism. [11] There are many consensus mechanisms protocols and newer protocols are constantly being created. There is no perfect protocol, and they all have their pros and cons. The most popular consensus mechanism used so far is the Proof of Work protocol. A key feature of Proof of work is that it requires the users to provide proof that the user had expanded a great amount of computational effort. The result of the work should be easy to verify but costly to generate, it is this cost of the work that makes fraud practically impossible due to how prohibitively expensive it is. [12]</p>
		<p>There is also a popular term called mining, which is a user node that can help process and verify transactions, then record the transactions into a new block and finally append the block onto the blockchain, based on their timestamp.[13] But to do this, the miner will have to generate Proof of Work, where they will be competing against other miners, after successfully appending a block to the blockchain, the miners will be rewarded a fixed amount of money in the form of the cryptocurrency they are mining plus the transaction fee.[14]</p>
		<p>There are many cryptocurrencies on the market today and many have their unique features. Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency created and is the most widely recognized cryptocurrency. However, Bitcoin does have its downsides:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Energy consumption</b>, Mining machines must consume huge amounts of energy to perform the trust-minimizing consensus, it is estimated that Bitcoin’s Annual Energy Consumption is higher than most European countries. [15] Nonetheless, energy consumption is not equivalent to carbon emissions as there are varieties of different energy sources that miners could use. </li>
		<li><b>Bitcoin fluctuation</b>, there is no valuation guaranteed in Bitcoin and its fluctuation is based on demand. There is also no regulation unlike in stock exchanges where inside trading and market manipulation can be mitigated. [16]</li>
		<li><b>Susceptible to the 51% attack</b>, there have been studies showing that there is a high concentration in mining where 0.1% of the miners control 50% of mining capacity and 10% of miners control 90% of the Bitcoin mining capacity. [17]</li>
		<li><b>Built-in deflation</b>, this system is designed to reward early adopters. The total number of Bitcoins is capped at 21 million, and each Bitcoin will be worth more as the rule of scarcity. The Bitcoin ecosystem is also dominated by a few concentrated players. This makes Bitcoin susceptible to systemic risks and gains from further adoption will most likely be disproportionately distributed.[18]</li>
		<li><b>High transaction fees</b>, every time users transfer Bitcoin, there will incur a transaction fee, the transaction fee helps to incentivize miners to process transactions. The more transaction fee you put up, the faster your transaction is likely to be confirmed. With block rewards halving every 4 years, there would be less incentive to mine without raising the transaction fees.[19]</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Cryptocurrency will most likely focus on its scalability, regulations, privacy and censorship resistance in the next years to come. It’s not likely for cryptocurrency to completely replace the Fiat currency we have. Financial institutions play a crucial role in keeping the stability in our economy and in determining which individual or company to issue its loans to. Cryptocurrencies may also pressure financial institutions to be virtuous in their policies and regulations.[20]</p>
		<p>In June 2021, El Salvador made Bitcoin a legal tender due to the country experiencing hyperinflation. Since then, despite the volatility, a lot of problems arose, due to the lack of transparency in regulations and issues with the cryptocurrency wallet called “Chivo” they were using. A lot of citizens protest that their money is getting hacked and stolen.[21]</p>
		<p>A growing number of businesses are starting to accept cryptocurrencies as payment methods. [22] I have used cryptocurrencies to make purchases, but the transaction fees are too much in my opinion. Not only does it cost money to transfer, just to exchange normal currency to cryptocurrency incurs a fee. The main convenience I use it for is sending money overseas, without having to go through all the paperwork required and all the headaches which you would normally experience if you were to send through at Western Union. Transaction fees could be reduced even more if sent to family or friends by allocating the funds to one of my wallets and giving them my wallet username and password. I see potential in cryptocurrency, but it is still early stages, and a lot of issues needs to be addressed for more people to accept and use.</p>
