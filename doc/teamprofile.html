  <div class="grid-item"><p><h1><p class="p1">Denise Freiburger:</h1></p>  
<p><h2>MBTI personality type: INTJ</h2></p> 
<p><h3>Strengths:</h3></p> 
<p>•	You have good interpersonal skills</p> 
<p>•	You are able to work with your team to resolve problems</p> 
<p>•	You are able to communicate effectively during teamwork</p> 
<p>•	You are able to manage the different tasks, goals and other aspects of teamwork</p>
<p>•	You are good at setting team goals</p> 
<p>•	You are skilled at planning and coordinating with teammates</p> 
<p><h3>Potential Strengths:</h3></p> 
<p>•	You are sometimes able to resolve conflict with teammates</p> 
<p><h3>Limitations:</h3></p> 
<p>•	You seem to prefer individual work over teamwork</p> 
<p><h3>Learning style:</h3> Solitary</p> 
<p>The results show I am strong in completing solitary tasks that challenge me, but weak when completing repetitive or ‘boring’ tasks.  I can lose focus quickly if I feel a task isn’t ‘useful’ or ‘signifcant’.</p> 
<p>I need to be aware of a tendancy to want to ‘do it myself’ instead of seeking assistance from team members.  I need to remind myself that others have different ways of operating and that doesn’t always mean they’re less
effective.</p> 
<p>A team should (where possible) be a blend of different personality types.  Difference can be useful as long as the team as a whole is open to listening to the ideas and thoughts of the other members.</p> </div>
  <div class="grid-item"><p><h1><p class="p1">Zhaohe Lin:</h1></p> 
<p><h2>MBTI personality type: ISTJ</h2></p>  
<p><h3>Strengths:</h3></p>  
<p>•	Honest and direct</p>  
<p>•	Strong willed and dutiful</p>  
<p>•	Very responsible</p>  
<p>•	Calm and practical</p>  
<p>•	Create and enforce order</p>  
<p><h3>Potential Strengths:</h3></p>  
<p>•	Able to apply myself to a variety of situations, picking up and applying new data and grasping the details of challenging situations as a matter of course.</p>  
<p><h3>Limitations:</h3></p>   
<p>•	I’m a bit insensitive and might hurt sensitive type feelings unintentionally.</p>  
<p><h3>Learning style: Solitary</h3></p>  
<p>Test results show that I’m a more introverted individual that prefers solitary activities and gets exhausted by social interaction. I’m also highly practical, pragmatic and down-to-earth. I have a strong ability to focus on what is happening or has already happened. I focus on objectivity and rationality, prioritising logic over emotions.</p>  
<p>I am highly self-disciplined and take responsibility for the tasks I perform. I work hard and stay focused on my goal which will prove me to be a valuable member of the team. My weakness is my introverted personality so that I will need to manage my interpersonal relations by speaking up at times when necessary and participating in group discussions. I need to ask questions when I’m in doubt and lend a helping hand to team members that struggle.</p></div>
  <div class="grid-item"><p><h1><p class="p1">Jennafer Allen:</h1></p>
<p><h2>MBTI personality type: ISTJ-T</h2></p> 
<p><h3>Strengths:</h3></p> 
<p>•	Honest and direct: manage situations with honesty and as simply as possible.</p> 
<p>•	Strong willed and dutiful: reliable and focused on seeing results.</p> 
<p>•	Very responsible: loyal to my word and any obligation I am required to meet.</p> 
<p>•	Calm and practical: works in a logical manner.</p> 
<p>•	Create and enforce order: creates structure in chaos.</p> 
<p>•	Jack-of-all-trades: easy to learn new information and then apply it in certain situations.</p> 
<p><h3>Potential Strengths:</h3></p> 
<p>•	I am a goal orientated person that can be relied upon to achieve tasks and help to focus the team’s outcomes.</p>   
<p><h3>Limitations:</h3></p> 
<p>•	I am a factual decision maker that is resistant to others’ ideas, even if my own is wrong.</p> 
<p><h3>Learning style:</h3> Independent</p> 
<p>My test results have indicated that I favor practical logic in my decision making. I have a strong belief in rules and order and the integrity of always following them. I am goals orientated and will give everything to a task that I am given until it is complete. I will aid this team by being a dedicated member who will strive for excellence and the completion of our goals.</p> 
<p>My weaknesses include the inability to manage indecisiveness or decision based on feelings not fact. As such, when working with Alpha One I should remain cognizant of this when working as a team. I can do this by enabling a positive environment where everyone’s beliefs are equal to my own and remain calm during the decision-making process.</p></div>
