  <div class="item14"><h1>Similarities</h1></div>
  <div class="item15"><p>All positions require some level of team based work.  Either as a team member or supervisor/manager.</p> 
<p>The Front End Developer and Service Delivery Manager both deal with cloud services/applications either as a developer or manager of a team of developers.  These roles are both client facing requiring the skills to deal with customers of the business and interpret their needs.</p></div>
  <div class="item16"><h1>Differences</h1></div>
  <div class="item17"><p>The Front End Developer role requires skills in web focused applications and languages.  This role includes the need for some knowledge of databases which isn’t noted for either of the other roles.</p> 
<p>The Cyber Defense Operations Lead requires security focused skills not required by either other role as well as the ability plan or scope requirements.  This role also involves training of staff.</p> 
<p>The Service Delivery Manager includes more high level management tasks such as personnel and change management.   This role additionally is responsible for supervising the provision of web services and thus requires knowledge of appropriate web services.</p></div>
  <div class="item18"><h1>Conclusion</h1></div>
  <div class="item19"><p>It appears from this sample that most IT roles require some level of team based work, either as a team member or supervisor/manager.  The ability to work in team would seem to be a critical skill.  This sample also indicates that a familiarity with cloud based services/applications will be an ongoing, if not, increasing component of IT careers.</p> 
<p>The difference in the roles in some ways serve to highlight the similarities.  Despite the technological difference, fundamentally, IT roles require a willingness and ability to work cooperatively with others.</p></div>
  <div class="item20"><h1>Personal Reflection</h1></div>
  <div class="item21"><p><h1>Denise Freiburger:</p></h1>
      <p>Front End Developer</p></div>
  <div class="item22"><p>This position works within client requirements to create client a cloud service with attendant applications.  The company is looking for a developer to work in a team on a new project, creating everything from the ground up. 
<p>The position requires experience with a range of commonly used web development languages and tools.  Javascript tools: React (React, A JavaScript library for building user interfaces) Webpack (Webpack, Bundle your assets) and Redux (Redux, A predictable state container for js apps); along with HTML, CSS, HTTP and REST(Restful API).</p> 
<p>The employer has advertised for a ‘front end developer’ but it appears they also require some experience with back end development and APIs.  This might be limited to ensuring the front end component works seamlessly with the Back end and thus ‘supports’ it,  however it appears that some back end experience, particularly with databases and database languages (eg SQL) are necessary.</p>  
<p>They are asking for 3 years experience as a minimum and place significant emphasis on collaboration within the team and generally.  However, it seems some independent decision making will also be required of the successful applicant. 
<p>I am currently unsuitable for the position as advertised.  I have familiarity with some of the concepts but no real hands on.   I do, however, have extensive experience working in teams, both for projects and long term.  I am also very experienced in making independent decisions to resolve issues in my work.  I have in the past, worked in a minor way with HTML, CSS and JavaScript but would in no way represent my skills as ‘experienced’.  I will require significant training to skill up to the requisite level for this position.</p>  
<p>To skill up with the requisite skills, I will continue to work towards the Bachelor of Information Technology degree, focussing where possible on subjects that will allow me to learn web development skills.  Outside of formal study, I will develop web pages and applications until I am confident in my design skills.  I will seek out other avenues of training in areas that particularly need development, ie, java script, back end apis and UI design.</p>  
<p>As I am ‘starting from scratch’ and skilling up, there will be a significant time investment required before I am able to do more than learn.</p></div>  
    <div class="item 23"><p><h1>Zhaohe Lin:</p></h1>
    <p>Cyber Defence Operations Lead</p></div>
    <div class="item 24"><p>This position requires one to lead a team of cyber security analysts to plan and carry out security measures to protect the company’s computer network, systems and data. Also requires reporting breaches and threats, simulating network attacks to find potential vulnerabilities and educating the rest of the company on security risks.</p> 
<p>The major requirements are to have experience in planning and carrying out security measures including attack modules and responsive activities. Also having previous work in a leadership role of a cyber defence team and also familiar with the operational technology and defence protocols used.</p> 
<p>I find this position most appealing to me as I will be leading a team and defending the company against some of the worst cyber attacks, being able to competently fulfill my role is a personal achievement on its own.</p></div> 
      <div class="item 25"><p><h1>Jennafer Allen:</h1</p> 
        <p>Service Delivery Manager</p></div>           
      <div class="item 26"><p>The job that I chose is for a position working within Commonwealth Bank as an SDM. The SDM role is heavily leadership focused however, requires technical knowledge and skills in cloud services.</p> 
<p>The prerequisite skills require knowledge and training in cloud services such as AWS and Azure. Furthermore, qualifications within the ITIL managing professional stream are essential. Additional on the job experience in change management processes, personnel management and customer liaison are also highly sort after for this role.</p> 
<p>I found this job specifically called to me as it works towards my personality strengths in leadership. Additionally, I found the challenge of managing the delivery of services instead of managing the backend of services to be the next natural progression and challenge in my career.</p></div>
